## Why use JustMix?

- Simple CSS value parsing and interpolation
- Interpolates colors, lengths, percentages, etc.
- Animate from the ground up with a performant advanced API
- Small download size with no dependencies

## Setup

### Setup for use in the browser
Include this script
```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/just-mix/dist/just-mix.min.js"></script>
```

### Setup for bundling (or if you want typings for TypeScript)

```bash
npm install just-mix --save
```

## Getting Started

Each CSS type in JustMix takes multiple values and returns a function that can be called to get the value at each offset. The offset is a number between 0 and 1 representing 0% to 100%.

```ts
var tween = just.mix.lengths('0px', '10px');
var onePixel = tween(.1);
var twoPixels = tween(.2);
var tenPixels = tween(1);
```

In this example, 1px is .1 or 10% of the way between 0px and 10px.

## API

Using JustMix is easy to use. Each css type has a simple function that takes three parameters.

### colors ()
Finds a color between two colors.  Weight is a ratio between 0 and 1 to use for mixing the colors

**Browser**
```ts
const purple1 = just.mix.colors('red', 'blue')(.5);
const purple2 = just.mix.colors('#ff0000', 'blue')(.5);
const purple3 = just.mix.colors('rgb(255, 0, 0)', 'blue')(.5);
const purple4 = just.mix.colors('hsla(0, 100%, 50%, 1)', 'blue')(.5);
```

**Bundled**
```ts
import { color } from 'just-mix';

const purple1 = colors('red', 'blue')(.5);
const purple2 = colors('#ff0000', 'blue')(.5);
const purple3 = colors('rgb(255, 0, 0)', 'blue')(.5);
const purple4 = colors('hsla(0, 100%, 50%, 1)', 'blue')(.5);
```

### lengths ()
Finds a length between two lengths.  Weight is a ratio between 0 and 1 to use for mixing the lengths

**Browser**
```ts
const fivePixels = just.mix.lengths('0px', '10px')(.5);
const fiveEms = just.mix.lengths('0em', '10em')(.5);
const fiveRems = just.mix.lengths('0rem', '10rem', .5);
```

**Bundled**
```ts
import { lengths } from 'just-mix';

const fivePixels = lengths('0px', '10px')(.5);
const fiveEms = lengths('0em', '10em')(.5);
const fiveRems = lengths('0rem', '10rem')(.5);
```

### numbers ()
Finds a number between two numbers.  Weight is a ratio between 0 and 1 to use for mixing the numbers

**Browser**
```ts
const fiveA = just.mix.numbers('0', '10')(.5);
const fiveB = just.mix.numbers(0, 10)(.5);
```

**Bundled**
```ts
import { numbers } from 'just-mix';

const fiveA = numbers('0', '10')(.5);
const fiveB = numbers(0, 10)(.5);
```

### percents ()
Finds a percentage between two percentages.  Weight is a ratio between 0 and 1 to use for mixing the percentages

**Browser**
```ts
const fivePercent = just.mix.percents('0%', '10%')(.5);
```

**Bundled**
```ts
import { percents } from 'just-mix';

const fivePercent = percents('0%', '10%')(.5);
```



## Advanced functions
Each css type has 4 additional functions that make up its simple function.  The four functions are as follows: ```parse()```,  ```format()```,  ```optimize()```, and  ```interpolate()```.  Normally, it is not necessary to use these directly, but for completeness, here they are.

### ```parse(val) => obj```

The parse function takes in each value and reduces it to an internal representation.  This is most often an array. In the case of ```lengths```, it is a two part array: [number, unitString].

### ```format(obj) => val```

The format function takes the internal representation and "formats" it back.  This normally returns a string.

### ```optimize(obj[]) => obj[]```

The optimize function takes a series of objects (the internal representations of the values) and makes edits so that they are in the most efficent format possible relative to each other.  For performance reasons, the original array is mutated.

### ```interpolate(obj, obj, weight) => obj```

The interpolate function mixes the two internal representations together relative to the weight provided and returns the result.

### An example of using the advanced functions in tandem

The advanced functions are most useful when dealing with a lot of values or the same values over and over again.  These are intended for building animations from the ground up.

```ts
var lengths = just.mix.lengths;
var keyframes = ['10px', '5cm'].map(lengths.parse);
var optimized = lengths.optimize(keyframes);

var currentObj = lengths.interpolate(optimized[0], optimized[1]);
var currentVal = lengths.format(currentObj);
```
